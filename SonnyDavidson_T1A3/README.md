<h1> Features </h1>
<h2> Engaging questions </h2>
<p> This trivia game has  wide array of questions from a bunch of different topics which aims to keep the plahyer engaged and should give them soem trouble  </p>
<h2> Easy to use </h2>
<p> One key point for me when creating this game was to have it be as user friendly as possible. that is why at the start and in all questions i list all of the possuble responses. This is also why at the start of the game you can type in 'help' and it will print all of the rules and controles for the game.   </p>
<h2> Interactive output of information  </h2>
<p> In the creation of this game i wanted to make sure that the user felt as involved as posible. This is why the first thing i do when the game starts is ask for the users name, this is then used in every statement made in the game. i also added that when you get a question wrong it tells you how many you got correct so you can track your progress. </p>
